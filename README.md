# Exploring-Bike-Sharing-Data-with-Tableau
Created worksheets, dashboards and stories from New York city bike-sharing data

# Overview
After taking a trip to Newyork and exploring the city on a bike, we came up with an idea to start a similar bike-sharing company in Des Moines. Kate also got a potential Investor who was interested to invest. Investors had to be convinced that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business plan. Our proposal was solidified by a bike trip analysis required by one of our key stakeholders.
